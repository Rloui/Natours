# Natours

Link to Live Project: https://rloui.github.io/Natours/

Application Summary: Natours is a mock web application a allows adventourous people to book various nature tours. This app was a tutorial from udemy where I leared advanced CSS, HTML, and JQuery concepts.

Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- Sass Folder Architecture
- BEM Class and ID Structure
- Git
- Github

Problems Encountered:
- when ever I added a new .sass file my sass code would not compile to the style.css file. This caused my HTML not to update and show design changes. I needed to restart the compile:sass script to solve this problem

Future Developments:
- add a backend to this frontend web application to allow users to interact with the website and store their data
